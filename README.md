# Visual-Story-Generator

The recent developments in deep learning models like CNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformers etc. have significantly improved the tasks related to visual and language learning. 
One of such task is visual story generation in which an image is given as input and according to that a story is generated by using the deep learning models. Our aim is to develop a similar application which can generate a story and recite it to the user. The input image features are extracted using VGG-16 model and from that, the captions are generated using LSTM which are given to GPT2-124M model finetuned on three diffrent genre of stroy corpus, for story generation.
